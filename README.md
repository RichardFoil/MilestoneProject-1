# MilestoneProject-1
This is a project for my software development bootcamp.
The objective of the project is to create a functional browser game.
I decieded to try and create an ilde clicker game!

The overall objective of the game is to get the highest score possible.(There is no end to the game, there is no loser only winners play this game!)

The game is simple!
When you click on the tree with the white x, you increase you score
You can spend your score upgrading your clicking power or creating things that will click for you!
Keep in mind this is meant to be an idle game, which means it is going to take a long time to get some of the upgrades and it is meant to be running in the background of whatever you are doing. 
The upgrades and  should be shown on the left side of the game. While the Store will be on the bottum and the score button all the way to the right
When you are done clicking you can commit your score by clicking the Submit button.
The submit button should relay what your total score was!
(in the future i would like to add a prestiege option to restart with increased rewards and inital clicking power)
(I would like to add an RPG element to the game where the player can make different choices to be rewarded ~ something like nature vs machinery)
(Achievements should be added to give the players some incentive to continue to play)
(A HighScore list should be added to compare progress of other players)
(I want to add more flavor to the game by having random characters walk around or have some sort of tangible story line)
(I want to find better art for the upgrades so that the whole game feels more cohesive.)
(I cant figure out how to save the image of the lumberjack, house, farm etc. so that it loads when a player hits the load button when coming back to the game.)
