- in the future i would like to add a prestiege option to restart with increased rewards and inital clicking power)
- I would like to add an RPG element to the game where the player can make different choices to be rewarded ~ something like nature vs machinery)
- Achievements should be added to give the players some incentive to continue to play)
- A HighScore list should be added to compare progress of other players)
- I want to add more flavor to the game by having random characters walk around or have some sort of tangible story line)
- I want to find better art for the upgrades so that the whole game feels more cohesive.)
- I cant figure out how to save the image of the lumberjack, house, farm etc. so that it loads when a player hits the load button when coming back to the game.)
