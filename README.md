# MilestoneProject-1
This is a project for my software development bootcamp.
The objective of the project is to create a browser game.
I decieded to try and create an ilde clicker game!
The overall objective of the game is to get the highest score possible.(There is no end to the game, there is no loser only winners play this game!)
The game is simple!
When you click on the screen, you increase you score/currency
You can spend you score/currency upgrading your clicking power or creating things that will click for you!
The upgrades and other purchaseable items should be shown on the side of the game.
When you are done clicking you can commit your score by clicking the Submit button.
The submit button should relay what your total score was!
(in the future i would like to add a prestiege option to restart with increased rewards)
(I would like to add an RPG element to the game where the player can make different choices to be rewarded)
(Achievements should be added to give the players some incentive to continue to play)
(A HighScore list should be added to compare progress of other players)
